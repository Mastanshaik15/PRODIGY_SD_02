Guess the Number Game
This repository contains a Python script for a simple "Guess the Number" game. The player attempts to guess a randomly generated number, and the game tracks the number of attempts it takes to guess correctly. This project is a fun way to practice basic Python concepts like loops, conditionals, and user input.

Project Overview
The "Guess the Number" game generates a random number within a predefined range, and the player must guess the number by entering their guesses. After each guess, the game provides feedback indicating if the guess was too high, too low, or correct. The game also tracks the number of attempts it took for the player to guess correctly and displays this information at the end of each game.

Features
Generate a random number for the player to guess
Provide feedback for each guess (e.g., "Too high", "Too low", "Correct!")
Track and display the number of attempts taken to guess the correct number
Allow the player to restart the game or exit after completing a round
Requirements
This project requires Python 3.x to run. No additional libraries are required, as the game is implemented with basic Python functions.
